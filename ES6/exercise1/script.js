// Write a function that takes an array as an argument
//and returns a new array containing all of the items
//that are in the array that was passed in
//but in reverse order.
//This function should
// leave the original array unchanged
// contain no loops of any kind. That includes for, for...in, for...of, while, and do...while
// not call slice or any other method on the original array
// not call push or concat on any array in any way
